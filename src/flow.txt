Summary
App.tsx is the entry point and defines the overall structure of the app.
Routes determine which component is rendered based on the URL.
Providers (AuthProvider, PremiumProvider) manage global state and make it available to all components.
Navbar provides navigation across the app.
Each route corresponds to a specific page component, which may include nested components for specific functionality.
